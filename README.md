# maze

Playground for the "maze" code kata

## Goal

Find a path from location `S` to location `E` in the maze given by the file [`resources/maze.txt`](./resources/maze.txt)
. Locations marked with `#` are walls, which cannot be traversed. Locations marked with `.` are corridors, which may be
traversed.

## Setup

1. Make your own copy of the `group_example` directory. Rename it, but keep the `group_` prefix.
2. Modify files inside your directory
3. Run your tests using `pytest <your folder name>`.
4. Have fun!
