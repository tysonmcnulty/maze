A maze has many, many locations
A wall is a kind of location
A corridor is a kind of location

A location is associated with a maze
A location has coordinates
Coordinates have an "x" value and a "y" value
A coordinate value is just a number

A corridor evidently has many neighbors, which are just corridors
